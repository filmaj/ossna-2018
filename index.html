                            Who here thinks of Adobe as an open source company? (not many hands go up) You aren't alone, it's not often that you hear Adobe and Open Source together.

                    Show stats from Tobi's OS company poll
                    <aside class="notes">Discuss the results from the poll. Discuss that fact that Adobe does have contributing to open source projects. Mainly in the apache space, Flex, jackrabbit, etc. Maybe it is a preception problem? Probably a part of it, but for the most part, the perception is correct. And it stems from the lack of open source culture at Adobe

                    <aside class="notes">Formed at the end of 2016 with the goals of improving the open source culture at Adobe. It was a grass roots type effort, with us only working on it part time. The original members were essentially volunteers as they still had day jobs. But the thing that brought them together was a shared love of open source and wanted Adobe to give back to the community. Goal: Grow open source at Adobe

                        Since we started out in more of a grass roots effort, it has been challenging to find executive support. We have had to prove ourselves constantly to grow and gain support.
